abstract = {Hough has proposed an interesting and computationally efficient procedure for detecting lines in pictures. This paper points out that the use of angle-radius rather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation further. It also shows how the method can be used for more general curve fitting, and gives alternative interpretations that explain the source of its efficiency.},

abstract = {The Hough Transform for straight line detection is considered. It is shown that if just a small subset of the edge points in the image, selected at random, is used as input for the Hough Transform, the performance is often only slightly impaired, thus the execution time can be considerably shortened. The performance of the resulting “Probabilistic Hough Transform” is analysed. The analysis is supported by experimental evidence.}
